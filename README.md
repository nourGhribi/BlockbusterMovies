This project was part of the course Data science in practice (MGT-415), it focuses on the TMDb 5000 movies data found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). In this project we do a thourough analysis of data (EDA) and we try to fit a ML model to predict movies success (ratings and revenues).
